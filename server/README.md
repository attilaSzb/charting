This directory contains a few data files about US states. Specifically, there are 3 files:
- states.json: Contains information about the abbreviations of states.
- population.csv: Contains information about the composition of the population of all US states.
- jobs.json: Contains information about the type of jobs within each state.

We would like you to build a small webapp that visualises this data in an attractive way. You are free to use any type of visualisation you want, and you can use any visualisation library you want. The goal of this is for us to be able to assess your frontend development skills (and to have some fun :) ). Don't worry about setting up a webserver to host the app, that isn't the focus of this assignment. We appreciate any effort you make to make your code readable (i.e. comments etc.), tested (i.e. unit tests), and easily extendable. You are also not limited to a single visualization! In fact, given the data, we expect at least 2 charts, which should be displayed simultaneously to create a "dashboard". The webapp should be responsive.

We have a couple of restrictions for this assignment:
1. The dashboard should be built using Polymer (either 1 or 2).
2. There should be a search field through which a user can search for a particular state and that state's data be shown/highlighted. 
3. The source code should be made available to us in a GitHub repository at least 2 days before we meet face to face, so that we can take a look in advance (please send us the link). During the technical interview we'll look at the code together, and will probably ask you some questions about you design choices and such.

Other than that, feel free to experiment and try stuff out :). If you feel the need to use more data, that's ok too (just be sure to be ready to explain why).
If you have any questions about the case, or would like further clarification, please let us know!
